# ppm_editing
An old pet project with multiple options for editing the color/size/orientation of images as well as combining them

PPM images are a fun way to explore image manipulation because each pixel is represented in a format that can be interpreted
by humans
Depending on the type of PPM, each pixel has 1 or 3 value (for grayscale and RGB), held in ints or chars.
